title: About

*Math-Classes* is a library of abstract interfaces for mathematical
structures, such as

 - Algebraic hierarchy (groups, rings, fields, ...)
 - Relations, orders, ...
 - Categories, functors, universal algebra, ...
 - Numbers: ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ...
 - Operations, ...

It's heavily based on Coq's new TypeClasses.

in order
to archieve:

 - elegant and mathematically sound abstract interfaces for algebraic
   and numeric structures up to and including rationals (with practical
   use of universal algebra and category theory);
 - a very flexible purely predicate-based representation of algebraic
   structures that makes sharing, multiple inheritance, and derived
   inheritance, all trivial;
 - clean expression terms that neither refer to proofs nor require
   deeply nested record projections;
 - fluent rewriting;
 - easy and flexible replacement and specialization of data
   representations and operations with more efficient versions;
 - ordinary mathematical notation and overloaded names not reliant on
   Coq's notation scopes.
